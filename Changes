   - correctly set the locale to C so that no internationalized 8bit-text

   - bugfix: sometimes the retry-window was not properly enforced
   - bugfix: argument parsing in postgreyreport (MJH)

     is used (Adrian 'Dagurashibanipal' von Bidder)

* 2004-12-14: version 1.17

   - added --auto-whitelist-clients option (Andreas Hoedle)
     it is turned on by default, to disable it specify
     --auto-whitelist-clients=0

   - increase max-time to 35, so that monthly newsletter are not
     greylisted (Stephen Gildea)

     (Michal Trojnara)

* 2004-08-18: version 1.15

  - fixed --retry-window with hours (Tom Baker)
  - update postgreyreport to version 1.14.2 (Tom Baker)
  - update whitelist

* 2004-07-12: version 1.14

  - lookup-by-subnet is default. "transition code" has been implemented, so that
    also a lookup with the unstripped IP will be tried. That way you shouldn't
    loose any data from the database when moving to version 1.14. Use
    --lookup-by-host for the old behaviour. All "address pool" entries are
    removed from the whitelist...
  - loosen "IP in reverse name" test (Matt Egan)
  - changed default --max-age to 30, since the db should shrink a lot
    because of the --retry-window functionality (you might want to
    db_dump/db_load your db to make it really shrink on disk)
  - another Perl 5.8.0 workaround
  - implemented --greylist-text (Tom Baker)
  - replaced X-Postgrey header with a X-Greylist header which is more similar
    to what greylist-milter does (Stephen Gildea)
  - implemented --greylist-action (Stephen Gildea)
  - updated postgreyreport (Tom Baker)
  - update whitelist

* 2004-07-05: version 1.13

  - strip sender address extension (everything after '+'), so that more
    VERP addresses are substituted to a unique string.
    (Stephane Bortzmeyer, Santiago Vila)
  - update whitelist
  - allow more than one --whitelist-xy option (Xavier Le Vourch)
  - implemented --retry-window (Tom Baker)

  - bugfix: wrong syslog call ('warn' instead of 'warning')
  - update whitelist
  - allow input with cr-lf lines for testing (Tom Baker)
  - implemented --lookup-by-subnet (Tom Baker)

    postfix restrictions: easier to setup)

* 2004-06-11: version 1.6

  - rewritten verp substitution code
  - when doing keys maintenance: report about how many keys there where before
    and after.
  - update whitelist

* 2004-06-03: version 1.5

  - default delay is now 300 seconds instead of 600 (received reports of
    mailers that try again the first time after 8 minutes and it doesn't seem
    to matter right now for filtering spam: they never come again)
  - report in the log the real time that is left, after which the triplet will
    be accepted
  - traverse the database for cleaning old entries only during the night
    and only once per day
  - more efficient traversal of database for cleaning (Matthew Reimer)
  - fix syslogging of warnings and fatal errors

* 2004-05-24: version 1.4

  - log removal was not working (need to call txn_checkpoint first)

* 2004-05-22: version 1.3

  - PID file generation with --pidfile (Ralf Engelschall)

  - use log_archive method every hour instead of DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE
  - cosmetic fixes (Ralf Hildebrandt)

* 2004-05-20: version 1.0

      and not who did implement it (which is mostly me)
